                Yes, you can use our projects in your portfolio. Frontend Mentor
                encourages users to showcase their solutions, as long as proper
                credit is given to Frontend Mentor for the designs. This helps
                demonstrate your coding skills and ability to translate designs
                into functional websites.

                If you're stuck, try reading the challenge again, looking up
                tutorials or guides online, or asking for help in the Frontend
                Mentor community. You can also check out other people's solutions
                for inspiration. Getting stuck is normal, so don't be afraid to
